This is a document classifier which categorizes document with tags.

Because of the legal issues and privacy concerns from the client, the original private repo in Bitbucket cannot be made public and only the codes can be presented. So, there is no training data provided and the programs of the classifier cannot be executed successfully to train models.

As a busy-committed project, some of the previous commits were shown in the example_commits directory.
